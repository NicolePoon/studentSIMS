## screenshot of Swagger UI API Endpoints
*NOTES:
*1. students API is pretty much the same as the one we did in tutorial;
*2. addresses API is created;
*3. The POST method is to add new address for a student using his/her StudentId;
*4. The PUT method is to change the address of a student using his/her StudentId and the address id(as there are possibly more than one addresses per student);
*5. Added another GET method to retrieve address(es) of a student with his/her StudentId.
